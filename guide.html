		<h2>Resources and Stratergies</h2>
		<p><span class="highlight">Minerals.</span><br>Planets are rich with resources, which can be used to construct your fleets and build up colonies. Though minerals will be a highly contested resource with much competition for access to them.</p>
		<p style="width: 60%; display: inline-block; float: left;"><span class="highlight">Happiness.</span><br>Your people work hard, and as their leader it is your job to keep them happy and healthy. Maintaing happiness will be important, espescially with new colonies who have never been under your rule.</p>
		<p style="width: 60%; display: inline-block; float: left;"><span class="highlight">Political power.</span><br>You hold the power of the empire, but that is not necessarily the will of others. Your political vantage will be contested for by your own peoples and political reforms will always be challenged, it is your job to maintain your power and lead your population into agreement with your vision.</p>

		<h2>Battle!</h2>
		<p><span class="highlight">Placed in control of an entire empire you are capable of almost anything.</span> Your position gives you control over your entire fleet, stragtically manouvering ships and colonizing planets. The game will possess 5 central forms of ships:</p>
		<p><span class="highlight">Colony</span> ships are able to set up small populations on foreign planets, they are full of civilians and thusly must be heavily guareded. They are central in your expansion and capturing enemy colony ships will be vital to hinder the enemies expansion</p>
		<p><span class="highlight">Medium</span> ships, a good mix between fast and bulky. They can take a good punch without geting knoked down, but are still fast enough to be manouvered around maps. They are a good unit to have and can be used diversly from defensive stratergies to a more aggressive takeover.</p>
		<p style="width: 60%; display: inline-block; float: left;"><span class="highlight">Light</span> ships, incredibly fast, swift and cheap to manufacture. The lighly armoured ships are a hinderence and annoyance to the enemy, and are best used in skirmishes against your foes.</p>
		<p style="width: 60%; display: inline-block; float: left;"><span class="highlight">Heavy</span> ships, pack a large punch, and are a good defensive unit. Though these ships are slow and must be delivered safely to a contesting point on the map.</p>
		<p style="width: 60%; display: inline-block; float: left;"><span class="highlight">Flagship</span> A marta to the success of your nation, your flagship has been fitted with the most powerful weaponry avaliable. It is expensive to make and manufacture so be weary when you send it into battle, if it is overwhelmed it may not be seen again, for a while at least.</p>

		<h2>Victory</h2>
		<p><span class="highlight">Contesting for the solar system.</span> The sun is close to dying, and with that the solar system will end in a giant supernova. You have limited time till this event occurs, but you are not the only one living in this system and your dominion will be fought for. Seizing power in the system will be hard but it is a vital step in the moving of your civilization!</p>

		<p>Your updated radars, have been able to fully detect all enemy presences. Your government has now implemented this technology into military use, and <span class="highlight">all enemy devices, planets and ships are highlighted in red</span>. Use this knowledge to your advantage. Yet due to limitations of this technology, the technology also highlights your devices, to minimise the complications with this <span class="highlight">your devices will be highlighted in a blue.</span></p>
